# Redis-Windows-32bit-master
Redis-Windows-32bit  The Windows 32-bit bin files for Redis can download here.  Some times we have to deploy our application on OLD Windows 32-bit OS. Just because the MSOpenTech(https://github.com/MSOpenTech/redis/releases) only support 64-bit version, we have to compile our ourself. Now you can SAVE your time download here.
